### 3. Classification
3.1 introduces the goals classification problem and contrasts it with the regression problem. It then demonstrates using a **binary classifier** to classify numbers in the MNIST dataset. With the results, it introduces performance metrics for classification problems including **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, **recall**, **specificity**, **precision**, **f1-score**, **ROC curve** and **ROC-AUC** values.

3.2 discusses resampling methods to handle lack of volume of data and to measure the stability of a model. It introduces the **train-test split**, then extends this method to **cross-validation** and **bootstrapping**.

3.3 extends the binary classifier to the **multiclass classifier** problem. In particular using the **one-vs-all** strategy or the **one-vs-one** strategy. 

3.4 and 3.5 implements **multi-label classification** and **multi-output classification** respectively. Multi-label classification is when a classifier can simultaneously predict two (or more) results from two groups of categories. Multi-output classification is where each result can be one of more than 2 possibilities.
